# Ancestor Prototype
Welcome to the ancestor game prototype! This was an original concept of my game in Unity using UI Toolkit. After spending sometime experimenting, I decided that instead of trying to get UI Toolkit to do what I wanted it would be easier to switch to an HTML / Angular project.

This project was built with Unity 2021.2.11f1 and should run when built in editor. It is no longer maintained. A lot of the decisions in making this project were purely experimental to see how I could best make my game engine.

## Features
The game allows the user to parse through various documents about their family and make discoveries about them. It is won when you make all the discoveries. Here is what exists in the game:

- Record requests to get documents to make discoveries
- Two types of documents: State Birth Indexes, Death Certificates
- A limited family tree page
- Unity Analytics tracking
- Random documents with fake data to throw the user off
