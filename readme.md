# Ancestor Prototype
Welcome to the ancestor game prototype! This was an original concept of my game in Unity using UI Toolkit. After spending sometime experimenting, I decided that instead of trying to get UI Toolkit to do what I wanted it would be easier to switch to an HTML / Angular project.

This project was built with Unity 2021.2.11f1 and UI Toolkit 1.0. It is no longer maintained. A lot of the decisions in making this project were purely experimental to see how I could best make my game engine.
